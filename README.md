## Overview

Data structures are essential tools in computer science for organizing and storing data efficiently. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster algorithms and better performance in software applications.

This repository aims to provide implementations of common data structures in Java, along with examples of their usage and operations.

## Data Structures

### 1. LinkedList

A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequential manner. Each element points to the next element in the sequence, forming a chain. This implementation supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### 2. Stack

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack. This implementation supports operations like push (insertion) and pop (removal) operations.

### 3. Queue

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue. This implementation supports operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

### 4. Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This implementation supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and searching.

### 5. Hash Table

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index where an element can be stored or retrieved efficiently. This implementation supports operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

## Installation

To use the data structures in your Java project, you'll need the following tools:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download the latest version of JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `apt` or `brew`.

2. **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository and manage version control. Install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or via package manager.

3. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** While not strictly necessary, an IDE can greatly improve your development workflow. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans. You can download and install an IDE of your choice from their respective websites or through package managers.

Once you have the necessary tools installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/impranavgarg/DataStructure_ByPranav.git
